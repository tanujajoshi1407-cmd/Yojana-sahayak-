## What the app uses today

- **Data origin:** every record is `curated_from_public_page`. No live API is called. The `live_api` origin and the "Live API" badge exist for future use only.
- **Scraping:** none. `npm run verify-sources` only requests each public URL once to check reachability (HEAD, falling back to GET), with a 0.5-second pause between requests. It never logs in, never bypasses CAPTCHAs, and never stores page content.
- **LLM:** the Anthropic Claude API, called from the server only. The API key is read from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
